This project contains three Python programs that build and analyze a 15-vertex subgraph of electric charging stations in North America:

Task 1 – Graph Construction & Fundamentals
Builds a 15-station connected subgraph using a ≤ 550 km edge threshold and a per-vertex degree cap ≤ 5 (0-weight edges removed). Exports the graph, matrices, and figures.

Task 2 – Connectivity, Network Flows & Shortest Paths
Uses the Task 1 graph to compute vertex/edge connectivity and cuts, a max-flow/min-cut between west/east sides, and a shortest path from A→O.

Task 3 – Graph Colouring
Uses the Task 1 graph to produce a proper greedy vertex colouring and a 5-colour edge colouring example.

All scripts must be in the same directory

RUNNING THE PROGRAMS
1) Task 1 – Build the graph (run first)

You should change path to the csv file on line 29

Constructs a connected 15-vertex subgraph and writes outputs to files used by Tasks 2 & 3.
Outputs created by Task 1 (in the repo folder):

    task1_graph.json ← required by Tasks 2 & 3

    task1_edges.csv

    task1_adjacency.csv

    task1_incidence_small.csv

2) Task 2 – Connectivity, Max-Flow/Min-Cut, Shortest Path

Requires task1_graph.json from Task 1.

Outputs:

    task2_flow.json

    task2_shortest_path.txt

3) Task 3 – Graph Colouring

Requires task1_graph.json from Task 1.

Outputs:

    task3_colouring.txt

    task3_edge_colouring.json

    task3_vertex_colouring.json
